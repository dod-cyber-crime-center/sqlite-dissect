Getting Started
===================

System Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++
SQLite Dissect depends on Python 2.7, with support for Python 3.x expected soon. It has been tested on Windows, OSX, and
Linux (Ubuntu) platforms.

To try to limit the need for dependencies, only one package is required for SQLite Dissect, which the `openpxl <https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ package
that is used for exporting the results into Excel format.

Installation
+++++++++++++++++++
SQLite Dissect is available from `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-dissect/>`_ and can be installed by running:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install sqlite-dissect

Alternatively, binary installations (packaged through PyInstaller) can be downloaded and installed from the `GitHub Releases <https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/sqlite-dissect/releases>`_ page.
