# While SQLite Dissect is primarily managed in GitHub, there are some forks that are being managed in GitLab instances.
# This runner configuration is analogous to what exists in ./.github/workflows/ci.yml but is configured for GitLab CI.
# As the primary repository resides in GitHub, this script does not include the logic to push the built wheel to PyPi.
# Pre-Requisites:
# - A GitLab runner with the `docker` executor that is tagged with `docker`.
# - Access to the internet for installation of dependencies during the build step.
# - If there's a proxy behind which the runner needs to be configured, set the PYPI_PROXY_URL environment variable.

stages:
  - Lint
  - Test
  - Build
